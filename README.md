# King-Pong
![Uploading New Project - Made with Clipchamp.gifâ€¦]()

This is the first project in my series of little educational projects. Goal of this project was to understand how things work in 2D space as well as to create my first "complete" game.
Everything I've been doing before was learning new skills by developing separate mechanics in separate projects, but none of those projects were completely playable.

King-Pong is playable, but mistakes were made, for example if you consider:

- downloading the project via ZIP-file
- opening the MainMenu scene
- and pressing Play button

you will have to try every button on your keyboard or gamepad to find buttons responsible for parying (Space or ), using skill (F or ) and picking up new shield (E or ). That's because
game lacks tutorial during which you would learn controls and game rules.

This project has taught me, what aspects of development appear more interesting to me. I also learned that when your project grows larger, it becomes cluncky. So in my next project I'll
focus myself on optimising project's architecture as well as on learning Unity's advanced tools functionality.
